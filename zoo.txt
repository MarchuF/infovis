explore, relate, and communicate the data
visualization is to aid our understanding of data
ability to see patterns, spot trends, and identify outliers
By making data more accessible and appealing
graphical perception
bar charts
line charts
scatter plots
time-series
statistical
maps
hierarchies
networks
Time-varying phenomena

aggregate patterns
Stacked graphs do not support negative
stacking may make it difficult to accurately interpret trends
multiple time-series
small multiples
trends
patterns
Horizon graphs
increasing the data density
how a set of numbers are distributed
visualizations is exploratory data analysis
